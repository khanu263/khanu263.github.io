**This site is deployed to [ukhan.dev](ukhan.dev).**

Most of the interactive elements are based on [Bootstrap](getbootstrap.com) components. The form is powered by [Pageclip](pageclip.co), which provides an upgraded account free for students through GitHub Education. Fonts are provided through [Google Fonts](https://developers.google.com/fonts) -- the headers are in [Overpass Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Overpass+Mono) and the body is in [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto).

One important trick that I did not develop myself is the offset span anchor for in-page navigation, which I got from Phillip Lovelace's [blog](https://pixelflips.com/blog/anchor-links-with-a-fixed-header). This is a very neat non-JavaScript method for ensuring that the sticky header does not cover up content when jumping around with the navbar.
